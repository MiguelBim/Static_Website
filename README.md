## Instructions
For local development, just run sudo `npm install` on the main directory and then `gulp` to get BrowserSync going along with all the Gulp tasks (see [Pear](https://github.com/jrdnbwmn/Pear)).

Development files are in `src`. Everything is compiled into `dist`, thatâ€™s where all your final files resid.
